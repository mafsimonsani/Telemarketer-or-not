# Telemarketer-or-not
Decide if a telephone number is a telemarketer number or not
#### CCC '18 J1 - Telemarketer or not?

Here at the Concerned Citizens of Commerce (CCC), we have noted that telemarketers like to use seven-digit phone numbers where the last four digits have three properties. Looking just at the last four digits, these properties are:

the first of these four digits is an 8 or 9;
the last digit is an 8 or 9;
the second and third digits are the same.

For example, if the last four digits of the telephone number are 8229, 8338, or 9008, these are telemarketer numbers.

Write a program to decide if a telephone number is a telemarketer number or not, based on the last four digits. If the number is not a telemarketer number, we should answer the phone, and otherwise, we should ignore it.
